# Corkboard Assignment - CS52

### What It Is

This project leverages Webpack, Babel, and React to create an online live note editing website.  You can create, delete, and edit notes using markdown, as well as drag around and resize the notes.  They perfectly handle z-indexes to keep the one you're working on on top!
